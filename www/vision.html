  <h1>Vision</h1>

  <h2>Our program</h2>

  We provide an enabling environment where children can discover their inner treasure, self-confidence, thrive in all aspects of learning in a play based home preschool program through quality learning experiences and guidance, so children will fully develop their cognitive, physical, emotional and social abilities in a safe and healthy environment. We capitalize on the children’s natural curiosity by providing materials that children can use in different forms during their play. The environment is set up with different activities and areas (dramatic play, arts/language table, block building, book corner, science and math activities, for example) so children are invited to explore and play freely.
  <br>
  <br>

  The different areas in the classroom are set up having in mind the children’s interest; therefore they might change frequently or not depending on my observation on the children’s play.

  <br>
  <br>
  We see ourselves as part of community of learners. Project Play recognizes and respects the valuable contribution made to our program by all participants. Children, Families, Educators and our Community at large.

  <h2>Our Children</h2>

  Are capable, competent, co-contributors who are active participants in their own learning. Children are born with an innate desire to explore and experience everything that surrounds them, to ask questions of these experiences, and to learn by doing.

  <h2>Our Families</h2>

  Families are a child’s most significant relationship and the first and most influential teachers. We are active in building strong partnerships and involvement with families on the care, nurturing and education of their children.

  <br>
  <br>
  We recognize that all families are not the same - we seek to build an environment that is inclusive, that recognizes, celebrates and builds on the strength of the diverse cultural backgrounds, languages, abilities and special needs of all children and their families and our team.

  <h2>Our Team</h2>

  Our team members show trust, respect and support to each other and share our talents and abilities.

  <br>
  <br>
  We take an ethical and professional approach to children and their families and apply our knowledge and expertise in all aspects of our work.

  <h2>Our Environment</h2>

  We can ensure that future of our planet by educating those who will inherit it. We foster a program that seeks to build a connection with and a sense of wonder regarding nature and concern for present and future sustainability by promoting environmentally thoughtful practices (i.e. - growing plants, minimizing waste, using materials thoughtfully and reusing/recycling.)

  <br>
  <br>
  Project Play encourages children to play indoors and outdoors daily, where their sense of wonder and exploration are supported.

  <br>
  <br>
  “This is the time to immerse children in the stuff of the physical and natural worlds. Constructing forts, creating small imaginary words, hunting and gathering, searching for treasures, following streams and pathways, making maps, taking care of animals, gardening and shaping the earth are perfect activities during this stage.” David Sobel

  <h2>Our World</h2>

  We acknowledge, respect and celebrate the culture and diversity within our community and beyond. We encourage children to develop a greater awareness of their wider world and how we are all participants in it.

  <br>
  <br>
  "Regular positive interactions within nature help children develop respect and a caring attitude for the environment. Not only are regular experiences in nature important, but also watching adults, both parents and teachers, modeling enjoyment of, comfort with, and respect for nature" (Cohen 1992 & Phenice & Griffore 2003, Wilson 1996).
